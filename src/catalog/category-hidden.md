title: Hidden Categories
---

There are many ways to use hidden categories. You might want to create additional category levels for your own internal purposes, but show only the higher-level categories to your customers. Or, you might want to link to a category that is not included in the navigation menu.

## To create hidden categories:

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Catalog** > **Categories**.

1. In the category tree, select the category you want to hide. Then, do the following:

   * Set **Is Active** to `Yes`.
   * Set **Include in Menu** to `No`.
  
1. In the **Display Settings** section, set **Anchor** to `No`.

    The hidden category is active, but does not appear in the top menu, or in layered navigation.

1. Although the category is hidden, you can still create subcategories beneath it, and make them active. Complete the following settings for each hidden subcategory:

   * Set **Enable Category** to `Yes`.
   * In the **Display Settings** section, set **Anchor** to `Yes`.

    As active categories, you can now link to them from other places in your store, but they will not appear in the menu.

1. When complete, click <span class="btn">Â Save </span>.
