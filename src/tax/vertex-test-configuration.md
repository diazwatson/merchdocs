## Troubleshooting Vertex API Automatically Disabled issue

If you update your product prices in the Magento catalog to include tax can significantly degrade Magento performance. Vertex will automatically disable if **[Display prices in Catalog]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link configuration/sales/tax.md %})** is set to Including Tax. You must set this value to Excluding Tax to re-enable Vertex. You will receive an error message in the [Vertex configuration page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link tax/vertex-configure-magento.md %}).

## Vertex Cache Management

When clearing caches using [Cache Management]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link system/cache-management.md %}), Vertex has a cache option included. This option improves performance during the checkout process.
