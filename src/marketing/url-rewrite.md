title: URL Rewrites
---

The URL Rewrite tool lets you change any URL that is associated with a product, category, or CMS page. When the rewrite goes into effect, any links that point to the previous URL are redirected to the new address.

The terms *rewrite* and *redirect* are often used interchangeably, but refer to slightly different processes. A URL rewrite changes the way a URL appears in the browser. A URL redirect, on the other hand, updates the URL that is stored on the server. A URL redirect can be either temporary or permanent. Your store uses URL rewrites and redirects to make it easy for you to change the URL key of a product, category, or page and preserve existing links.

By default, [automatic URL redirects]({{ site.baseurl }}{%- link marketing/url-redirect-product-automatic.md -%}) are enabled for your store. The "Create Permanent Redirect for old URL" checkbox is marked under the URL key field of each product.
